# Advent of Code solutions

My solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) in python (a way to keep my python fresh :D).
The solutions for each day are designed to be independent without any set of _shared utility code_ or _generic code library_, unless the problem explicity references another day.

Participated in 2015 and 2016. Couldn't really participate on 2017, 2018 and 2019. Got back again on 2020 - solving both 2020 and 2019... will eventually get to 2018 and 2017 (whenever the chance) :)

...done solving 2024, now on to completing 2023 first

Status:
* [2024] 50*

* [2021] 50*
* [2020] 50*
* [2019] 50*
* [2018]    
* [2017] 40*
* [2016] 50*
