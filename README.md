# Advent of Code solutions

My solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) in python (a way to keep my python fresh :D)

Participated in 2015 and 2016. Couldn't really participate on 2017, 2018 and 2019. Got back again on 2020 - solving both 2020 and 2019 (whenever the chance)... will eventually get to 2018 and 2017 :)



#### TODO after 2020
* Recover my 2015 and 2016 solutions and add them here
* Finish 2019
* Begin 2017, 2018
